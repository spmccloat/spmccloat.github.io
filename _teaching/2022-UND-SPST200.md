#### 2018 - 2022 (6 semesters, ~300 students)

Complete responsibility for teaching, grading, and managing the department's 200-level introduction undergraduate course.  Four main units: Astronomy, Planetary Science, Spaceflight History, & Spaceflight Applications. 

Developed a "current events" weekly discussion that was very popular, and timely, as private space launches and international tension created important moments that students wanted to discuss. Also implemented a popular extra-credit opportunity wherein students would suggest a song "related to outer space" that I compile into a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3KfujKdKibbsEHWa9MMSEd?si=9ce2701a12ab46d1 "SpaceJams Vol 3"). 

Teaching before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic was challenging but instructive to develop variety of teaching and communication strategies - both in-person, hybrid, and fully remote.
