### Research
I am deeply motivated by the possible diversity of living worlds and life's extent in the universe. My research drives:
- at understanding the formation and arrangement of planetary systems to better understand where to find habitable planets and 
- observing planetary atmospheres to reveal what those planets are actually like. 

To that end, I:
- published a paper reporting a putatitve detection of sodium in the atmoshpere of hot Jupiter KELT-10b using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy from VLT-UVES. 
- model of planet formation by pebble accretion which self-consistently builds planets and tracks their composition; exploring the kinds of planets that appear around different stars may help explain key observational trends and narrow down the best places to look for living planets.

 On the side, I enjoy mythology, folk music, and science fiction.

 ### Science Communication
I am finishing up my dissertation from the University of North Dakota Space Studies department while living in Ithaca, NY with my partner. I am passionate science communicator with years of experience:     
- developing astronomy labs for undergraduate students (SUNY Geneseo),  
- crafting and delivering planetarium shows to large, diverse audiences (Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum),  
- teaching several semesters of 200-level science courses (UND Space Studies),  
- education and outreach activities for K-12, and college students, with [North Dakota Space Grant Consortium](https://ndspacegrant.und.edu/) 
- and presenting my research at colloquiums at several universities.
