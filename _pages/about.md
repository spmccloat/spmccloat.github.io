### Science Communication
I am finishing up my dissertation from the University of North Dakota Space Studies department while living in Ithaca, NY with my partner. I am passionate science communicator with years of experience:     
- developing astronomy labs for undergraduate students (SUNY Geneseo),  
- crafting and delivering planetarium shows to large, diverse audiences (Suffolk County Vanderbilt Museum),  
- teaching several semesters of 200-level science courses (UND Space Studies),  
- education and outreach activities for K-12, and college students, with [North Dakota Space Grant Consortium](https://ndspacegrant.und.edu/) 
- and presenting my research at colloquiums at several universities.  

Recently, I participated in the [2023 NASA ExoExplorers](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/exopag/exoexplorers/exoexplorers-welcome/) professional development program with a dozen other early career exoplanet scientists and presented on the early stages of [my dissertation research](https://youtu.be/4SWC7NGWaW0). 

### Research
I am deeply motivated by the possible diversity of living worlds and life's extent in the universe. My research drives at understanding the formation and arrangement of planetary systems to better understand where to find habitable planets and observing planetary atmospheres to reveal what those planets are actually like. To that end, I have published a paper reporting a putatitve detection of sodium in the atmoshpere of hot Jupiter KELT-10b using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy from VLT-UVES. Finally, my dissertation research is developing a model of planet formation by pebble accretion which self-consistently builds planets and tracks their composition; exploring the kinds of planets that appear around different stars may help explain key observational trends and narrow down the best places to look for living planets.

 On the side, I enjoy mythology, folk music, and science fiction.
