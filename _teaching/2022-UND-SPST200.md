As a TA, was given complete responsibility and control for teaching, grading, modifying, and managing the departmental undergraduate introductory course. Eventually developed a "current events" weekly discussion that was very popular, and timely, as private space launches and international tension created important moments that students wanted to discuss. I also implemented a very popular extra-credit opportunity wherein students would suggest a song "related to outer space" that I would compile into a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3KfujKdKibbsEHWa9MMSEd?si=9ce2701a12ab46d1 "SpaceJams Vol 3.).
