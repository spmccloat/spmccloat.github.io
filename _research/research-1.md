The PPOLs Model is a combination of two prior models of pebble accretion: pebble-predictor by Drazkowska et al. 2021, and the pebble accretion recipes from Ormel & Liu (2018) and Liu & Ormel (2018). The name plays off of combineing "PP" for pebble-predictor and "OL" for Ormel & Liu. 

The model produces a planetary system of planetesimal/cores grown self-consistently by pebble accretion, for stars ranging from ~M - A type stars, disks of theoretically any solid/gas mass, and any number, mass, and distribution of seed cores. The seeds grow while a snow line is calculated and evolves self-consistently as pebbles coagulate and drain from the disk. The bulk composition between rocky/dry mass and icy/wet mass is tracked for pebbles and seeds as they grow.
